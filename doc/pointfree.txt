INTRODUCTION                                          *pointfree-introduction*

Haskell programmers often write in pointfree style, which is considered
cleaner. The existing tools for transforming a function definition into
pointfree style are wonderful, but it would be even better if these were
integrated into the text-editing experience.

USAGE                                                 *pointfree-usage*

With your cursor on the line of Haskell you want to transform, run `:Pointfree`
to replace that line with the pointfree version.

Alternatively, use `:PointfreeSelection` to run pointfree on the visual
selection.

Here is an example configuration:

>
  nnoremap <leader>Hp :Pointfree<CR>
  vnoremap <leader>Hp :PointfreeSelection<CR>
<

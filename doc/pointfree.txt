INTRODUCTION                                          *pointfree-introduction*

Vim's diff mode is pretty good, but there is no convenient way to quickly bring
up all modified files in a diffsplit. This plugin aims to provide a simple,
unified, single tabpage interface that lets you easily review all changed files
for any git rev.

USAGE                                                 *pointfree-usage*

With your cursor on the line of Haskell you want to transform, run `:Pointfree`
to replace that line with the pointfree version.

Alternatively, use `:PointfreeSelection` to run pointfree on the visual
selection.

Here is an example configuration:

>
  nnoremap <leader>Hp :Pointfree<CR>
  vnoremap <leader>Hp :PointfreeSelection<CR>
<
